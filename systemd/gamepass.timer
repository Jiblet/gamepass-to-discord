# ‚ö†Ô∏è  Note to self:
# Avoid restarting this timer between scheduled ticks unless you're okay with an immediate service run.

# If you want to change the schedule without triggering the service, use:
#   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
#   sudo systemctl enable gamepass.timer
#   sudo systemctl start gamepass.timer
# This ensures the timer activates but waits for the next OnCalendar event.

[Unit]
Description=Run gamepass-to-discord hourly

[Timer]
OnCalendar=hourly
#Persistent=true
# üï∞Ô∏è About Persistent=true:
# If this line is present, systemd will "catch up" missed runs after downtime or restarts.
# For example, if the last hourly tick was 08:00 and the system boots at 08:23,
# it will immediately run the service to compensate for the missed 08:00 trigger.
# Removing this line disables that behavior ‚Äî future runs will only happen at the next scheduled tick.
